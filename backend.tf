# PURPOSE:
# - Store Terraform state (terraform.tfstate)
#   in a remote S3 backend
# - Enable safe concurrent execution using
#   S3-based state locking (Terraform ≥ 1.5)
# - Ensure the same state is shared across:
#     • GitHub Actions
#     • Virtual Machines
#     • Local development
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - This S3 bucket must be created manually
# - This bucket must NOT be managed by Terraform

    key = "abc-startup/terraform.tfstate"

    # Use modern S3-native state locking (Terraform >= 1.5)
